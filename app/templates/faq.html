	  <h4>How does bitscramblr work?</h4>
	  Bitscramblr is an application that will turn pseudoanonymous Bitcoin transactions into
	  anonymous Bitcoin transactions. It is an extension of the concept of a shared wallet.
	  <br><br>
	  As proven by researchers at The University of MÃ¼nster, Germany, many of the existing services
	  which perform bitcoin anoynmization, do so inadequately:
	  <br>
	  <i> 
	  "In our analysis of Bitcoin Fog we found a clear structure, making it possible to
	  understand how the service works. This might make it easier for an attacker who has
	  additional information available to detect outgoing transactions."
	  </i>
	  <br>
	  <i> 
	    "In the analysis of the service BitLaundry, we found direct connections in the transaction
	    graph in two of our three experiments, in the last one we directly received half of the
	    coins, we payed in. Thus, BitLaundry cannot be considered to reliably increase anonymity."

	  <br><br>
	  To ensure <strong>complete</strong> anonymity, bitscramblr blocks until adequately sized inputs are available
	  from a source other than the origin.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <h4>Minimum transaction size?</h4>
	  We recommend a minimum transaction size of 0.01 BTC. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <h4>Maximum transaction size?</h4>
	  Currently, the maximum transaction size is 1 BTC. This will be raised in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <h4>How long do transactions take?</h4>
	  To ensure complete anonymity, bitscramblr blocks until adequately sized inputs are available
	  from a source other than the origin. If there is enough BTC in the system, transactions should
	  happen as fast as a regular bitcoin transaction with standard fees (15-30 minutes).
	</p>
	<p>
	  <h4>What data is kept?</h4>
	  For quality assurance, data regarding the transaction origin is stored on the server temporarily.
	  Once we verify that a transaction has gone through, all data corresponding to that transaction's origin
	  is deleted. We anonymously store the number of transactions that have taken place for statistical purposes,
	  and it makes for a nice way to prove our reliability.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <h4>Is bitscramblr open source?</h4>
	  <a href="https://github.com/ehickox2012/bitscramblr">Yes,</a> under the Apache 2 License.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <h4>What are bitscramblr's limitations?</h4>
	  Bitscramblr is completely, mathematically, anonymous. This means that there is no direct path from
	  your transaction's origin to its destination. So in that sense, its only limitation is that the
	  transaction will not go through until there are adequately sized inputs available from another source.
