	<h3>Bitscrambl your applications!</h3>
	<p>
	  Want to provide anonymous Bitcoin transactions for your users? Now you
	  can with Bitscramblr's RESTful API!
	</p>
	<p>
	  It's as simple as sending a GET request to http://www.bitscramblr.com/api/receive
	</p>
	<p>
	  Include parameters:
	  <br>
	  destination
	  <br>
	  amount
	</p>
	<p>
	  We'll generate a new Bitcoin address and return it in our response. From there,
	  once the address we provide is filled, we'll send Bitcoin to the destination you provide.
	  <br>
	  Our response should look something like this:
	  <br>
	  <samp>
	    {
	    'address': 'XXX',
	    'amount': XXX,
	    'destination: 'YYY'
	    }
	  </samp>
	</p>
      </div>
